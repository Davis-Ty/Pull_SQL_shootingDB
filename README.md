# SQL script demonstrates several good coding practices:

- Comments: Clear and concise comments are included throughout the script, explaining the purpose of each section or query. This enhances code readability and helps other developers understand the logic behind each query.
- Meaningful Alias Names: Meaningful aliases are used for table names and columns, making the code more understandable. For example, "WP" represents the "data-police-shootings-master.zip" dataset, while "TG2015" and "TG2016" represent the years 2015 and 2016 in "thecounted-data.zip" dataset.
- Formatting and Indentation: The code is properly formatted and indented, following a consistent style. This improves readability and makes it easier to identify query blocks and clauses.
- Modularity: The script is modular, addressing specific tasks or questions individually. Each query focuses on a particular analysis, such as counting deaths by gender or identifying top states with the most deaths in a given year.
- Use of Functions: The script utilizes SQL functions effectively, such as COUNT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and LIMIT, to perform aggregations, sorting, and limiting the output results.
- Data Filtering: Conditions are applied to filter data based on specific criteria, such as filtering by year using the STRFTIME function to extract the year from the date column.
- Comparative Analysis: The script compares results between different datasets and years, highlighting any differences or discrepancies. This allows for a deeper understanding of the data and helps identify potential inconsistencies or variations in reporting.
- Overall, the script demonstrates good coding practices by emphasizing clarity, organization, and thorough analysis of the data
